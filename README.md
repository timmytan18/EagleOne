Reinventing Mobility in Atlanta Data Analytics subgroup

Our VIP (Vertically Integrated Project) research team at Georgia Tech is focused on developing the data science to improve mobility in Atlanta. Our data science sub team is to visualize and analyze relationships between the Atlanta population, MARTA (bus) routes, and accessibility to points of interests such as schools, hospitals, and stores. To do this, we gathered GTFS data from MARTA and points of interests and utilized R to map these data with the help of the GTFSR library.
